# kanban

A full-stack MERN application with CRUD capabilities that allows users to create kanban boards. It uses a Node.js back-end that serves an API and connects to a MongoDB database. A React front-end accesses the API to allow users to move cards between lists, edit cards, rename lists, remove cards, remove lists, and delete boards.
